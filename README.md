# FakeMarket

Simulated financial-market infrastructure for studying how electronic trading systems work internally.

FakeMarket models order processing, order books, matching, risk, financial state, durability, recovery, market data, performance, and (eventually) distributed execution.

**This is not a real-money exchange.** All activity is simulated.

## Current status

```text
Phase 0  — Engineering Foundation
Milestone M0.2 — Engineering Standards  (complete)
Milestone M0.1 — Repository & Build System  (complete)
```

What exists today:

- Go module and repository layout
- Thin application entrypoint with graceful shutdown
- Configuration skeleton (environment + HTTP port)
- Structured logging (`log/slog`)
- HTTP health check (`GET /health`)
- Makefile developer workflow
- CI (format, vet, lint, test, build)
- [Engineering standards](docs/engineering-standards.md) (binding constitution)
- ADRs 0001–0004 (foundation, numbers, identity/sequence/time, errors/logging)
- Domain primitives only: `Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`, typed IDs, `Sequence`

What does **not** exist yet (by design):

- Orders, trades, order books, matching engine
- Risk, accounts, positions
- WAL / snapshots / recovery
- Trading or market-data APIs
- Docker / Kubernetes / distributed execution

---

## Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- Make
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) v2.x (optional locally; required in CI)

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Full local validation
make check

# Run the application
make run
```

Health check (in another terminal):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Stop with `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) or `SIGTERM` — the process shuts down gracefully.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FAKEMARKET_ENV` | `development` | Runtime environment label |
| `FAKEMARKET_HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP listen port |

Example:

```bash
FAKEMARKET_ENV=staging FAKEMARKET_HTTP_PORT=9090 make run
```

---

## Development commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make build` | Build binary to `bin/fakemarket` |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make fmt` | Format source |
| `make lint` | Static analysis |
| `make vet` | `go vet` |
| `make run` | Build and start locally |
| `make check` | fmt-check + vet + lint + test + build |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |

---

## Repository layout

```text
cmd/fakemarket/     Application entrypoint (thin)
internal/config/    Configuration loading & validation
internal/server/    Runtime lifecycle + health endpoint
internal/domain/    Foundational primitives (IDs, numbers, sequence)
pkg/                Reserved for future public libraries (empty)
test/               Future integration/system tests
docs/               Engineering standards + ADRs
scripts/            Utility scripts
.github/workflows/  CI
```

### Why this layout?

- **`cmd/`** owns process wiring only — no domain logic in `main`.
- **`internal/`** is private to this module; external importers cannot depend on it.
- **`pkg/`** stays empty until something is truly reusable outside the binary.

## Planned architecture (not implemented)

```text
Trading Client → API Gateway → Order Management → Risk → Instrument Shards
                                                          → Matching Engine
                                                          → Executions / Market Data
                                                          → WAL → Snapshots / Recovery
```

Evolution is incremental: correct single-process exchange first, distribution later.
